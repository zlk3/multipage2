# Pitt Fuego Webtext Generator

Welcome to Pitt Fuego Webtext Generator! This tool allows the user to mix and match div. blocks to build a quick website similar to an Adobe Spark. All of the design elements you need to make a great webtext or presentation are embedded in the document. We've also provided hidden comments to help guide you through the process. See [Video](https://youtu.be/KVUBbM7pIYw?si=S02HKRwmh-psrWHJ)

We recommend you begin with one of our starter programs before using this one. 
   


## Get started!


1. Scroll to the top of this repository and click the green "**Code**" button. Select "**Download ZIP**" to download project files to your local computer. These are all the project files you'll need to get started working with code.

2. Find this project folder in your downloads and move it to a secure place. You will return to this folder to manage your files and other assets like images, pdfs, etcetera. 

3. Download and/or open a code editor. We recommend  [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (See download and setup instructions below).

4. Use the code editor to open your project folder. Open index.html document. Read through the code comments embedded in the index.html document. Here, you'll find all the information you need to work with code! 

5. Once you have modified and added content to your project, you will want to publish your webtext to the internet. GitHub provides a good publishing solution. If you do not already have one, create a GitHub account. [Go to GitHub](https://github.com/)

6. Create a new repository to house your project files. Click  "**uploading an existing file**" and upload your project files to your repository and "**Commit changes**". You'll need ALL of your assets to make your webtext function properly. 

7. Now go to your repository "settings." Scroll down to **"GitHub Pages"** in the left-hand menu. Change the source setting from **"none"** to **"main" "/root"** and then Click "Save"

8. GitHub will now provide you with a published URL. (This process may take several minutes.)

9. Test the URL in a browser. Magic, no? Actually, it's computer science.
